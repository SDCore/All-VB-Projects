' Purpose: To calculate the cost of a stay at campgrounds under different conditions.

' --TODO--
' Another function should compute 7.5% tax. Total = Subtotal / 7.5%. TheTotal = Total + Subtotal. Pass back to calling method
' Pass all values to a sub procedure to displaying results.
' Subprocedure displays: Subtotal Billing Amount for your Stay, Taxes for your Stay, and Final Total
' Input values need a Try-Catch block

Option Strict On
